# KNN QQQ Trading Model — Progress Log

## Project Summary
KNN-based model trained exclusively on QQQ data to predict next-day direction.
Predictions are translated into TQQQ/SQQQ position recommendations for a $50K account.
Goal: consistent daily profit via EOD signal generation.

## Architecture
- **Training data**: QQQ + auxiliary (VIX, SPY, IWM, TLT, GLD) — NO TQQQ/SQQQ in training
- **Model**: KNN classifier with walk-forward validation
- **Output**: Daily JSON recommendation (buy TQQQ, buy SQQQ, or cash)
- **Position sizing**: Confidence-scaled, max 50% of account per trade
