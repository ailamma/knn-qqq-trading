# KNN QQQ Trading Model — Progress Log

## Project Summary
KNN-based model trained exclusively on QQQ data to predict next-day direction.
Predictions are translated into TQQQ/SQQQ position recommendations for a $50K account.
Goal: consistent daily profit via EOD signal generation.

## Architecture
- **Training data**: QQQ + auxiliary (VIX, SPY, IWM, TLT, GLD) — NO TQQQ/SQQQ in training
- **Model**: KNN classifier with walk-forward validation
- **Output**: Daily JSON recommendation (buy TQQQ, buy SQQQ, or cash)
- **Position sizing**: Confidence-scaled, max 50% of account per trade

## Session Log

### Session 1 — Project Initialization (2026-02-14)
- **What was done:**
  - Created full project directory structure
  - Created feature_list.json with 28 features across 6 phases
  - Created claude-progress.txt (this file)
  - Created init.sh bootstrap script
  - Created README.md with project documentation
  - Created requirements.txt with all dependencies
  - Created .gitignore
  - Initialized git repository with initial commit
- **Current state:** Project scaffolding complete. No code written yet.
- **Next step:** Start Phase 1 — Feature F001 (Download QQQ data)
- **Blockers:** None
- **Features completed:** 0 / 28

### Session 2 — F001: Download QQQ Data (2026-02-14)
- **What was done:**
  - Created `data/download_qqq.py` — downloads QQQ daily OHLCV from 2011-01-01 via yfinance
  - Downloaded 3,802 rows (2011-01-03 to 2026-02-13) to `data/raw/qqq_daily.csv`
  - All 6 columns present: Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume
  - Verified: no NaN values, no gaps > 3 business days
  - Marked F001 as passes: true in feature_list.json
- **Current state:** F001 complete. Raw QQQ data ready.
- **Next step:** F002 — Download auxiliary data (VIX, SPY, IWM, TLT, GLD)
- **Blockers:** None
- **Features completed:** 1 / 28

### Session 2b — F002: Download Auxiliary Data (2026-02-14)
- **What was done:**
  - Created `data/download_auxiliary.py` — downloads VIX, SPY, IWM, TLT, GLD
  - VIX: 6,821 rows from 1999-01-04
  - SPY: 6,821 rows from 1999-01-04
  - IWM: 6,468 rows from 2000-05-26
  - TLT: 5,925 rows from 2002-07-30
  - GLD: 5,343 rows from 2004-11-18
  - No NaN values in any dataset
  - Date alignment verified against QQQ (full overlap where dates exist)
  - Forward-fill logic included for up to 3 days if needed
- **Current state:** F001 + F002 complete. All raw data downloaded.
- **Next step:** F003 — Create merged master dataset
- **Blockers:** None — GLD starts late (2004) so master dataset will start from ~2004-11-18
- **Features completed:** 2 / 28
